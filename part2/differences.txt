What are the two types of Intents?
Explicit and Implicit Intents

Which of the two types of Intents are more secure?
Explicit Intents, because implicit intents do not verify what service will respond to the intent or even where the service orignates.
Explicit intents do verify the trustworthiness of the source of the intent.

What type of Intent is shown on lines 69 to 73 of SecondFragment.kt?
var intent = Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW) is an example of an implicit intent.

What type of Intent is shown on lines 68 to 70 of ThirdFragment.kt?
var intent = Intent(activity, ProductScrollingActivity::class.java) is an example of an explicit intent as it refernces the Java librarys
fully qualified component class name.

Which of these two Intents is the proper way to do an Intent?
The thirdfragment.kt is the correct intent as it properly references the JAVA class for ProductScrolling explicit which increases the application security.  Both the
two intents intend to do the same functionality, thus I replaced the intent in SecondFragment.kt with ThirdFragment.kt.
