Once again the developers left the same vulnerability as the past few assessments, where a hacker can access/use 
a gifr card belonging to someone else.  In the past assignments this has been due to a lack of authentication checking
in the use gift card section and the same applies here.  All the hacker has to do to use someone elses giftcard is to change
the id field which is directly used in the url path.  To fix this, add additional verification when retrieving the user id.
This can be done using information from the token, when the token is verified, use the user information associated with it like the
user name to grab the id and use that as the id for the url.
